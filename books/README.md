## About the Video Course

Starting from the fundamental concepts of containers, this course gradually unfolds into a comprehensive guide on managing and deploying applications with Kubernetes. It covers everything from the basics of Kubernetes architecture and its components, such as Pods, ReplicaSets, and Deployments, to advanced topics like networking with Services and deploying microservices architectures.

As you progress, you'll gain hands-on experience with Minikube, create Kubernetes manifest files using YAML, and set up a real-world development environment. You'll learn to deploy two-tier web apps and use Docker Compose. The course also includes a deep dive into Kubernetes operations across major cloud platforms, including GCP, AWS, and Microsoft Azure, equipping you with the knowledge to operate Kubernetes in the cloud confidently. It wraps up with an exploration of CI/CD pipelines, illustrating how Kubernetes integrates into the DevOps workflow for continuous integration and deployment.

By the end, youâ€™ll not only understand how Kubernetes works but also be able to deploy, manage, and troubleshoot applications in a Kubernetes environment.
